Implement support for more than the PS5V2, i.e. the other PsikyoSH boards?

In MAME, check what global variables are initialized with before main() is
called, then add corresponding inits to the C code, including zero inits. May
need to do some automation for this task, since there's so much data to look
over.

Ensure constant data is stored and accessed from ROM, and variables/code are
copied to RAM and code executed from RAM once main() is called. But maybe add
an option to execute code from ROM, so more RAM is available, assuming ROM code
execution is fast enough on PS5V2.
