System data used by the game and managed by the system: 0x6060000 ... 0x6064767
Game data: 0x6064870 ... 0x607CF0F
System data only managed by the system: 0x607CF10 ... 0x60B19B4
Some only-system-managed data is read by the game code.
Some system data is used by the C library.

The game code begins at main() (0x6000000) up to ShowRankingCode() (0x60236BE).
The system code begins at 0x6023788 up to 0x60304AE.
The C library starts at Div32s (0x60305C0) up to the last function, MemSet (0x6030C64).

The _start() function is in ROM (0x400), and appears to have been written by
Psikyo, in hand-written assembly, and not modified by Arika. A C version of
_start has been written as a reference of what it does, until the C version is
rewritten in SH-2 assembly.
